    # This makes it so that the git repo is downloaded everytime, which is 
    # undesirable. Without this if the user specified file extraction when
    # installing SecurityOnion then this directory will exist and cause the
    # the git clone of the new file extraction scripts to fail.  This is the
    # hack to make it work until I find a better way.
    #
    # Long term this will need to be fixed as it causes not only the repo to be
    # downloaded everytime this playbook is run, but it also causes a
    # bro deploy everytime which interupts processing uncessary and is a 
    # time intensive process.
